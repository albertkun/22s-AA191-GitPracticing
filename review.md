UCLgAy|Leaflet.Sleep, leaflet-sidebar-v2|We looked at Leaflet.Sleep and leaflet-sidebar-v2, and we think we'll use these for our project. Leaflet.Sleep removes the annoying Leaflet map zoom-in when scrolling on the page, while leaflet-sidebar-v2 will be useful for creating a responsive layout, where we can put our interactive chart and then have it collapse when the user wants to view the map. |Example|
Team International|leaflet-pulse-icon|Creates a cool pulsing icon that can be passed into L.marker to be put on the map. color changes the pulse color and fillColor changes the color of the dot.|https://lindseymardona.github.io/22s-asiaam-191a-labs/week10/|
